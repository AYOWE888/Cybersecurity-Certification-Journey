### ❓ Question 1: Separation of Duties
**Question:** A financial firm requires that any change to the core router configuration must be authorized by a manager in writing and then implemented by a network engineer. Which control category best describes this 'Separation of Duties' policy?
* **My Answer:** Managerial ✅
* **Logic:** High-level governance policies and administrative procedures that dictate how security is managed fall into the **Managerial** category. It is a procedural requirement for humans, not a software-driven enforcement.

### ❓ Question 2: SIEM Monitoring
**Question:** An administrator reviews automated alerts from a SIEM that show an IP address attempting to brute-force a login. The administrator then manually blocks the IP. Which control type provided the initial alert?
* **My Answer:** Detective ✅
* **Logic:** **Detective** controls, such as SIEM alerts and logs, are specifically designed to identify and signal that a security event has occurred. The manual block is corrective, but the alert itself is the discovery tool.

### ❓ Question 3: Physical vs. Psychological Controls
**Question:** To protect a remote data center, a company installs a fence with barbed wire and a 'No Trespassing' sign. While the fence is physical, which control type best describes the intended effect of the 'No Trespassing' sign?
* **My Answer:** Deterrent ✅
* **Logic:** Signs and warnings are **Deterrent** controls. Unlike a fence (which physically stops you), a sign attempts to influence the intruder's decision-making process by suggesting consequences.

### ❓ Question 4: The Zero-Day Workaround
**Question:** A company discovers a zero-day vulnerability in their web server. Since a patch is unavailable, they deploy a specific Web Application Firewall (WAF) rule to block the exploit traffic. What type of control is the WAF rule in this specific scenario?
* **My Answer:** Compensating ✅
* **Logic:** A **Compensating** control is a temporary 'Plan B' used when the primary security control (in this case, the software patch) is not available.

### ❓ Question 5: Training & Awareness
**Question:** A new employee is required to attend a mandatory 4-hour security awareness session and sign an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Which control category does the actual act of training the employee fall into?
* **My Answer:** Operational ✅
* **Logic:** **Operational** controls involve daily or periodic activities conducted by people, such as training sessions, physical security reviews, and configuration management.
