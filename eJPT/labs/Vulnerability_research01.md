# 🕵️ eJPT Lab Report: ACKme IT Services

**Target IP:** `240.228.189.136`  
**Phase:** Enumeration & Vulnerability Assessment  
**Status:** 🟢 **Success (Flag Captured)**

---

## 🔍 1. Information Gathering & Enumeration
Following the **eJPT v2 methodology**, the engagement began with active reconnaissance to map the target's attack surface.

* **Tool:** `Nmap`
* **Objective:** Identify open ports, active services, and specific version numbers.
* **Results:** Discovered a web service on **Port 80**. Version detection identified a specific software build linked to known public vulnerabilities.



---

## 🛡️ 2. Vulnerability Analysis
After identifying the service via Nmap, the workflow transitioned to **Vulnerability Research**:

* **NVD/CVE Cross-Referencing:** The service version was validated against the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).
* **Exploit Selection:** Leveraged **Exploit-DB** to find a matching Proof of Concept (PoC) for the specific version found during enumeration.



---

## 🚀 3. Exploitation (The "Showcase")
Using the verified research findings, a targeted attack was executed to gain unauthorized access.

* **Attack Vector:** Remote Code Execution (RCE).
* **Outcome:** Successfully established a **Reverse Shell**.
* **Post-Exploitation:** Verified access level via the `whoami` command.
* **Flag Captured:** `THM{ACKME_ENGAGEMENT}`
