# 🕵️ eJPT Lab Report: Metasploit Fundamentals & EternalBlue

**Target Lab:** TryHackMe - Introduction to Metasploit  
**Date:** 2026-02-27  
**Status:** 🟢 Complete

## 🧠 Part 1: Theoretical Knowledge (What I Learned)

I developed a foundational understanding of the **Metasploit Framework (MSF)**, focusing on its three-tier structure: **User Interface** (msfconsole), **Modules** (the functional code), and **Tools**.

### **The Module Hierarchy**
I learned that MSF is categorized into specialized modules based on the phase of the penetration test:
* **Auxiliary:** Supporting tasks like scanning, fuzzing, and sniffing.
* **Exploits:** The "means" used to take advantage of specific vulnerabilities.
* **Payloads:** The "cargo" delivered to the target. I learned the four types:
    * **Adapters:** Wrappers (like PowerShell) to change the format.
    * **Singles:** Self-contained, one-shot code.
    * **Stagers:** Small code that sets up the connection "channel."
    * **Stages:** Larger code (like Meterpreter) downloaded by the stager.
* **Encoders & Evasion:** Used to bypass Anti-Virus and signature-based detection.
* **NOPs:** Used as "padding" to keep payload sizes consistent.
* **Post:** Used for post-exploitation (gathering hashes, pivoting, etc.).

## 🛠️ Part 2: Practical Application (The EternalBlue Lab)

In the practical phase, I applied the **MSF Workflow** to exploit a Windows target vulnerable to **MS17-010 (EternalBlue)**.

### **1. Navigation & Setup**
I used the core MSF commands to prep the environment:
* **`search`**: Located the EternalBlue module.
* **`use`**: Selected the module `exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`.
* **`info`**: Reviewed the module's documentation and requirements.
* **`show options`**: Identified that `RHOSTS` (Target) and `LHOST` (My IP) were required.

### **2. Execution**
* **`set`**: Configured the target parameters.
* **`exploit`**: Launched the attack.
* **Result:** Successfully established a **Meterpreter session** on the target.
