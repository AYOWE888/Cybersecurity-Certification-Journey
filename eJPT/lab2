# 🕵️ Laboratory Report: Advanced Network Reconnaissance
**Target:** TryHackMe - [Further Nmap](https://tryhackme.com/room/furthernmap)
**Date:** January 19, 2026

## 🎯 Objective
To master firewall evasion and advanced service enumeration techniques required for the eJPT certification.

## 🛠️ Methodology & Execution
To bypass the target's firewall (which blocked ICMP/Ping requests), I utilized the `-Pn` flag to force port discovery.

### 🖥️ Technical Findings
| Metric | Discovery Result | Command Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bypass Technique** | ICMP Firewall Evasion | `nmap -Pn` |
| **Open Ports (5k)** | **[INSERT NUMBER]** | `sudo nmap -sS -Pn --top-ports 5000` |
| **FTP Status** | Anonymous Login: **[YES/NO]** | `sudo nmap --script ftp-anon -p 21` |

### 🔍 Service Enumeration
* **Port 21:** Running `[INSERT FTP VERSION]`
* **Port 80:** Running `[INSERT HTTP VERSION]`

## 🧠 Major Lessons Learned
1.  **Firewall Evasion:** Standard scans fail when ICMP is blocked. Using `-Pn` is critical for eJPT engagements to ensure "hidden" hosts are scanned.
2.  **The Power of NSE:** Nmap is more than a scanner; the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) allows for automated vulnerability discovery (e.g., `ftp-anon`).
3.  **Stealth vs. Accuracy:** Using the Stealth SYN Scan (`-sS`) provides a balance of speed and reliability while staying below the radar of basic logging.
