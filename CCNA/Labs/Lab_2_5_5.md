## ⌨️ Configuration Highlights
In this lab, I performed the "Day 1" tasks required to take a Cisco switch from out-of-the-box state to a basic secured state.

### 1. Device Management & Identification
* **Hostname:** Changed from default `Switch` to `S1` to identify the device within the network topology.
* **Banner MOTD:** Configured a "Message of the Day" to provide legal notification that unauthorized access is prohibited.

### 2. Access Security (The "Triple Layer" Defense)
* **Console Security:** Secured physical access by adding a password to `line con 0`.
* **User EXEC Mode:** Implemented password requirements for initial entry.
* **Privileged EXEC Mode:** Used the `enable secret` command to protect global configuration mode 

### 3. Data Protection & Persistence
* **Password Encryption:** Applied `service password-encryption` to ensure that all passwords (like the console password) are not stored in plain text in the configuration file.
* **NVRAM Save:** Verified the configuration and committed the `running-config` to the `startup-config` to ensure settings persist after a power cycle.

```bash
S1# copy running-config startup-config
Destination filename [startup-config]? 
Building configuration...
[OK]
