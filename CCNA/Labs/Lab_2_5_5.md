## ⌨️ Configuration Highlights
I performed the following security and management tasks on the Switch:

### 1. Hostname & Management Security
* Set Hostname to **S1**.
* Secured **Privileged EXEC** mode with the `enable secret` command.
* Secured the **Console** line with a password and required login.

### 2. Information Security
* Implemented a **Banner MOTD** to warn unauthorized users.
* Used `service password-encryption` to ensure all passwords in the config are hashed.

### 3. File Persistence
* Executed `copy running-config startup-config` to save the work to NVRAM.

```bash
S1# copy run start
Destination filename [startup-config]? 
Building configuration...
[OK]
