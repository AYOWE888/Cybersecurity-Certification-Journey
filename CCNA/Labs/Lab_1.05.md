## 🛠️ Hands-On Skills

| Skill | Application |
|-------|-------------|
| Logical Navigation | Visualizing data flow between end devices and switches. |
| Physical Placement | Organizing hardware in server racks and wiring closets. |
| Device Identification | Configuring a hostname for the backup router via CLI. |

---

## 🔍 Lab Reflection

- **Router Naming:** Setting a unique hostname (e.g., `Router-Backup`) is critical for administrative clarity and security logging.
- **Layer 1 Simulation:** Improper cabling in Physical mode results in link light failures, simulating real-world hardware errors.
